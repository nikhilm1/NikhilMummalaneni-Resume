        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I am Nikhil Mummalaneni, a Business Administration major with a minor in Computer Science at the University of California, Riverside, aspiring to go in the intersection of technology and business. I am not just a student of theory but a practitioner of practical business and technical applications. My academic journey has included taking coursework in financial and managerial accounting, alongside comprehensive principles of economics. <br><br>

        My professional experience is diverse, highlighted by my upcoming role as a Summer Analyst at PSG Equity, a growth equity firm focused on investing in B2B enterprise software. With a total of $14 Billion in assets under management, they are one of the largest firms in this space. Prior to this, I used my analytical and operational skills at Navalper, a search fund based in San Diego. My efforts streamlined operations, significantly reducing processing times and enhancing inventory availability, thereby impacting the bottom line positively. My initiative and a keen eye for opportunity led to the successful sourcing of potential acquisition opportunities. 
<br><br>

        At Hike, a unicorn in the Web3 Gaming space, I spearheaded marketing campaigns and cultivated partnerships with influencers, driving brand awareness and product adoption. My role required me to navigate the nuances of blockchain and cryptocurrency and ensure our marketing strategy resonated with the diverse geographical markets we targeted.<br><br>
        
        Entrepreneurship is a part of my DNA, shown by the creation of the Skyblock Coinshop, a venture that combined my passion for digital commerce with my interest in community engagement. This initiative not only proved financially successful but also created a vibrant community of over 8,000 users and a YouTube channel with over 2 million views.
<br><br>
        Leadership roles have been instrumental in shaping my professional journey. As the President of my schoolâ€™s Blockchain & Cryptocurrency Club, I pioneered educational initiatives, and partnerships, and promoted financial literacy amongst the student population, reaching over 125 students. My ongoing participation in the Career Accelerator finance programs underscores my commitment to continuous learning and professional development, with a focus on mastering the intricacies of finance and business.
<br><br>
        Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, my interests include being a Laker Fan. I indulge in cooking exotic food, and I am currently focusing on summer Italian food. My dedication to fitness is evident through my passion for nutrition, I make sure to drink a protein smoothie every morning to keep me focused and disciplined. As a youth basketball coach, I impart not just the skills of the game but also the values of teamwork and perseverance to the younger generation. <br><br>
